- 👋 Hi, I’m Leon Rañon
- 🏡 I work as a freelance web developer / Virtual Assistant / Trader / Entrepreneur
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a good developer and also build a startup in the near future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu at UDEMY and I'm also reading Head First Javascript Programming. It was really an amazing feeling learning from this. I look forward to learn more and be proficient/comportable in using these technologies. I'm also excited to create awesome things with these. 🤩🤩🤩
