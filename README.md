- 👋 Hi, I’m Leon Rañon
- 🏡 I work as a freelance web developer / VA / Trader / Entrepreneur
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a good developer and also build a startup in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from Complete web developer course by Dr. Angela Yu at UDEMY and I'm also reading Head First Javascript Programming. It was really an amazing feeling learning from this. I look forward to learn more and be proficient/comportable in using these technologies. I'm also excited to create awesome things with these. 🤩🤩🤩
